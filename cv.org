* Hobbies and Interests

** Programming
I have enjoyed experimenting with programming and development in my
free time from the age of 9. I have enjoyed having projects I can work
on which keep me thinking of new ways to tackle problems. Quite often
these will lead me to experiment with new technology or languages. I
contributed to the Open Source game engine Maratis 3D. I have also
started a number of small projects whose aim is to experiment in
approaching different programming projects which have become a
collection of "Tiny Little" libraries.

** Playing Games
In what free time I have available, I have always enjoyed playing
games to relax. My taste in games is fairly broad, ranging from games
released when I was younger (and before!) to modern games. Some of my
favourites are Role Play Games such as the Final Fantasy, and The
Elder Scrolls series' and Space Simulations such as the X series, and
Freespace.
